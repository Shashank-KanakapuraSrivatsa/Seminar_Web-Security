\chapter{Conclusion}
Desynchronization attacks can be very effective in a chained system environment and can cause substantial damage. This fact has been established throughout this report. Even though this technique was first discussed way back in 2005 by WatchFire \cite{b5}, it was ignored for a very long time owing to its complexity. However, due to the efforts of the author in \cite{b6} this technique has again gained popularity and it has been proved to be practically realizable.

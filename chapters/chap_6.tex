\chapter{Defence against HTTP Desync Attacks}
The author in \cite{b6} has not only proposed techniques to carry out HTTP Desync Attacks but has also suggested the defence mechanisms or preventive measures to protect a website from such attacks. We mention a few of them here :
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lesser number of layers decrease the risk of desynchronization attacks. Websites not containing load balancers, CDNs and reverse proxies are almost immune to desynchronization. 
	\item Forcing the frontend servers to use HTTPS/2 \cite{b15} while communicating with backend. 
	\item Disabling backend connection reuse.
	\item Same webserver software with identical configuration can be used to run all the servers in a chain. 
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Conclusion}
Desynchronization attacks can be very effective in a chained system environment and can cause substantial damage. This fact has been established throughout this report. Even though this technique was first discussed way back in 2005 by WatchFire \cite{b5}, it was ignored for a very long time owing to its complexity. However, due to the efforts of the author in \cite{b6} this technique has again gained popularity and it has now been proved to be practically realizable. In this report, I have initially tried to provide some background information about HTTP and its headers. The entire agenda of this report is to provide an insight to HTTP Desynchronization attacks. In various sections of this report, we have understood the basic core concepts of request smuggling. A step-wise approach to carry out a desynchronization attack has been explained elaborately with atleast one example or case study. Several attack methods to reap the benefits of desynchronization have also been highlighted.

\chapter{Problem Statement}
HTTP/1.1 was first documented in RFC 2068 \cite{b9} and since its inception, it supports sending multiple HTTP requests over the same TCP or SSL/TLS socket. The HTTP requests are sent back to back and the server uses the HTTP headers to identify where a request ends and the subsequent request starts.
